# cloudconverter

Simple Node.js web app that has an endpoint which takes POST requests, to compress the images that I upload on my own S3 buckets using my <a href="https://github.com/buuraak/image-optimizer">Image optimizer</a> app.

This application uses the following:
1. Express
2. Dotenv
3. Cloudconvert

Things I'd like to do:
1. For now this app is being hosted on Vercel. In the coming weeks I'd like to create my own server using DigitalOcean and then connect a domain to this server.
2. Create a homepage with proper styling which explains the use of this app. Now I just have a simple H1 tag with no styling.
